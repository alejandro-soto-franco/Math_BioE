# Math_BioE

**Mathematical Bioengineering**: A formal framework for modeling biological systems via measure theory, differential operators, and spectral analysis.

## Overview

`Math_BioE` is a collection of mathematical simulations and theoretical tools designed to rigorously model and analyze biological phenomena using structural measures and geometric function spaces. The repository emphasizes the distinction between **local biological observables** (e.g., gene expression density) and **global system-level quantities** (e.g., tissue-wide energy, information, entropy) through the lens of modern mathematical analysis.

This project draws inspiration from:

- Measure-theoretic probability,
- Functional analysis and $L^p$-spaces,
- Weighted Laplacians (Witten-type),
- Spectral geometry and variational calculus,
- Biological applications: gene regulation, morphogen gradients, tissue energetics.

## Motivation

Biological data are inherently **local**, noisy, and sampled with bias. However, design, inference, and control demand **global understanding**. Measure theory provides the only consistent mathematical bridge between the two.

We adopt a structural approach:

> Define biological relevance through the **measure** itself. Modify the geometry by weighting the volume element, and let diffusion, expression, and control emerge from the spectrum.

## Features

### Local-to-Global Modeling

- Expression profiles $f(x) \in L^2(\mu)$
- Structural weighting via $d\mu(x) = w(x)\, dx$
- Computation of weighted $L^2$-norms and functional integrals

### Spectral Geometry Tools

- Discretization of Witten Laplacian:
  $$
  \Delta_w = \frac{1}{w(x)} \frac{d}{dx}\left( w(x) \frac{d}{dx} \right)
  $$
- Eigenvalue problems: compute modes of biological diffusion
- Orthonormal basis in $L^2(w\, dx)$ for signal decomposition
- Visualization of spectral basis functions

### Biological Interpretability

- Map structural weights $w(x)$ to energy, accessibility, or repression fields
- Quantify regulatory burden as a spectral energy
- Use eigenmodes for clustering, signal smoothing, or network control
